  <div><p>Introduction:</p><p>Diversity in the workplace is something that is very important to a lot of people. It not only helps the company that the people work for, but the mindset of the current ones working.
  More people want to work in a diversified workplace than not, with around 67% of people looking for jobs in an actively diversified workplace, as gathered in a study by Glassdoor. When people actively support and hire diversified teams, it makes for a more productive job too. Racially diversified teams not only make more revenue, 19% to be exact (Boston Consulting Group), but they outperform the average team by 35% (McKinsey).
  Language and communication across multiple different groups of people connect. Connecting with other multilingual people and companies is integral for the survival of a diverse workplace, and this can only happen by hiring more people who speak more languages.(International Business Seminars)</p></div>
  <div><img src="people.jpg" height= "200px"><img src="peopletwo.jpg" height="200px"><img src="peoplethree.jpg" height="200px"></div>
  <div><p>Hiring people on the edges of the typical “working age” is also important. Younger employees are known to bring new ideas to the field, and according to a study by Inc, by 2025 around 75% of the main working force will be millenials. Hiring them as people retire is very important to keep businesses running how they should be. Hiring older individuals is also important, those who either have to come out of retirement or never were in it. They most likely have had similar training to their current job and would need less of a training period, and are very likely to take their job very seriously.
  Not all people have equal opportunity, and those who grow up in low income neighborhoods and towns have much less of one than anyone else. In data from the 2014 census, around 4 out of 10 children are poor at least one year before their 18th birthday, when they would usually be going to college. Many good schools and extracurricular programs are more focused on richer neighborhoods, leaving little opportunity for them to thrive. Hiring these people gives a good outside perspective on issues other people may not be conscious of, and the quality of work is usually just as good as anyone else.</p></div>

<div id="Ethnic Differences" class="tabcontent">
  <p>Background Complex:</p>
  <p>The most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau articulated that racial and ethnic discrimination affect the aspect of employment.

  No individual can be denied equal employment opportunity because of his/her birthplace, ancestry, culture, linguistic characteristics, or accent.

  African Americans and Hispanics are underrepresented, particularly in STEM jobs, along with their presence in the overall U.S. workforce.

  Together, these two groups are accounted for only 16% of those employed in a STEM occupation. As they are not often employed, being who they are, they face the issue of marginalization, in which the way they are perceived even affects the outlook of the workforce racially.  </p>

</div>

<div id="Language and Communication" class="tabcontent">
  <p>According to Cary Funk and Kim Parker:</p> <p>Cultural and language differences can hinder effective communication. Workers who are not fluent in the primary language used in the workplace may have difficulty expressing their needs or responding to requests from colleagues.
Workers may then be unwilling to adjust to the ways of workers from different cultural backgrounds than their own
Although the most commonly spoken language in the United States is English, the number of people speaking other languages is increasing.
An article by Deloitte, “Diversity and inclusion is not an HR strategy; it is a business strategy… research also shows that teams that operate in an inclusive culture outperform their peers by a staggering 80 percent.” Henceforth, an open and widespread community can enable industries to thrive.</p>

</div>

<div id="Age Differences" class="tabcontent">
  <p>According to Matt Wilson:</p>
<p>It has been shown that millennials, despite their knowledge are unable to make their visions come to reality.
This factor is preventing companies from hiring a millennial despite their background.
The stereotype of having a “technology addiction” seemed to have spread quite the amount.
As far as older individuals seeking for a job, they also face a stereotype of being unable to work with technology.
The chances of having some work experience is quite high, yet companies refuse to consider otherwise.
As a result, it is imperative for the industry to change its mindset and be more open to the community.</p>

<div id="Financial Situations" class="tabcontent">
  <p>Authors of the paper titled “Childhood Environment and Gender Gaps in Adulthood”, Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Frina Lin, Jeremy Majerovitz, and Benjamin Scuderi,  found that:</p>
<p>If both parents have a high income, men are more likely to get hired than women.
If both parents make much less money, women are more likely to be hired for jobs.
Another paper by Caroline Ratcliffe showed that children from birth through age 17 show a much greater prevalence of poverty than government censuses.
Four out of every 10 children are poor for at least one year before they reach their 18th birthday.
In black families, about 75% are poor at any point during childhood. That same statistic for white children is a lot, but considerably lower at approximately 30%.</p>

</div>

<div id="Potential Solutions" class="tabcontent">
<p>Based on the collected data regarding the situation of  anti diversity in the workforce, it can be said that ways to prevent this issue include:</p>
<p>Making sure equal opportunities are given to minorities and low-income neighborhoods.
Holding employers and employees responsible for the lack of diversity in the workplace.
Sharing the decision-making process.
Paying attention to organizational culture to promote a welcoming environment.
Be aware of unconscious bias and unfair judgement in favor of one person or group over the other.</p>
